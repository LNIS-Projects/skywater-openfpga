# Skywater PDK
This directory is the workspace for running Synopsys Design Compiler for FPGA primitives
This required to synthesis decoders in FPGA fabrics
Please keep this directory clean and organize as follows:
- **HDL**: Any HDL to synthesis
- **SCRIPT**: Scripts to enable Design Compile runs
- **RPT**: Report files from Design Compiler runs 
- **TEMP**: workspace for Design Compiler projects
- READMD is the only file allowed in the directory, others should be sub-directories.
