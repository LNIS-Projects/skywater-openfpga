Introduction
------------

All the FPGA devices in this project are fully open-source, from the architecture description to the physical design outputs, e.g., GDSII.
All the devices are designed through the OpenFPGA framework and the Skywater 130nm PDK. 
The devices are embedded FPGA IPs, which are designed to interface the caravel SoC interface.
We aims to empower embedded applications with its low-cost design approach but high-density architecture.
Operating temperature ranging from 0 :math:`^\circ C` to 85 :math:`^\circ C`
