----------

FROG is the FiRst Open-source fpGa, which is designed through a no-human-in-the-loop automate flow. Built on a state-of-the-art 14nm FinFET technology, FROG aims to empower embedded applications with its low-cost design approach but high-performance architecture.

- Multi-mode 6-input Look-Up Table (LUT) technology, which operate as dual-output 5-input LUTs, as well as four-output 4-input LUTs.

- Native support on up-to 600-bit shift registers as well as ripple-carry adders

- 512Kb dual-port block RAM populated in 16 independent on-chip memory banks

- Operating temperature ranging from -40 :math:`^\circ C` to 85 :math:`^\circ C`

- Packaged by wire-bonded BGA
