# Skywater PDK
This directory contains the testbenches for FPGA fabrics that are automatically generated by OpenFPGA or tuned for a specific FPGA fabric.
Please keep this directory clean and organize as follows:
- Each testbench should be placed in a separated directory
- READMD is the only file allowed in the directory, others should be sub-directories.
