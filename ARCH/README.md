# FPGA architecture description
This directory contains the FPGA architecture description files for OpenFPGA tool suites.
All the FPGA architecture description are binded to the opensource skywater 130nm PDK

* Keep this folder clean and organized as follows
  - **vpr\_arch**: FPGA architecture description for VPR
  - **openfpga_arch_template**: template FPGA architecture description for OpenFPGA.
  - **openfpga_arch**: adapted FPGA architecture description for OpenFPGA which are converted from the templates.

* Note: 
  - Please **ONLY** place folders under this directory
    README should be the ONLY file under this directory
  - VPR and OpenFPGA architecture files should be placed in separated directories
