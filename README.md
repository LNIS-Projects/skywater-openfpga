# skywater-openfpga
FPGA tape-outs using the open-source Skywater 130nm PDK and OpenFPGA

* Keep this folder clean and organized as follows
  - DOC: documentation of the project
  - ARCH: Architecture XML and other input files which OpenFPGA requires to generate Verilog netlists
  - BENCHMARK: Benchmarks to be tested on the FPGA fabric
  - HDL: Hardware description netlists for the FPGA fabrics
  - SDC: design constraints
  - SCRIPT: Scripts to setup, run OpenFPGA etc.
  - TESTBENCH: Verilog testbenches generated by OpenFPGA 
  - PDK: Technology files linked from skywater opensource pdk
  - SNPS\_ICC2: scripts and workspace of Synopsys IC Compiler 2
                Keep a README inside the folder about the ICC2 version and how-to-use.
  - MSIM: scripts and workspace of verification using Mentor ModelSim

* Note: 
  - Please **ONLY** place folders under this directory
    README should be the ONLY file under this directory
  - Each EDA tool should have independent workspace in a separated directory
